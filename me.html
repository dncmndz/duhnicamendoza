he is a work in progress. She is wonderfully and fearfully made by God. She seeks to make everyone around her happy and strives to inspire others. She takes pain and 
fuels it to her creative advantage. Despite all of that, she is consumed by her own darkness— her insecurities and self-doubt. She is that girl that tries to love
 more even if it's difficult. She's an eighteen year old girl who's striving to achieve her dream of being  a Forensic Psychologist. She was born in the hometown of one 
of the most known heroes of our country, Dr. Jose Rizal. She grew up in a conservative family and was also sent into a Catholic school from grade school until now. She's
the youngest of three siblings. She loves to read novels especially thriller, dystopian genre and young adult books. During free time, she usually manage her fangirling 
twitter accounts, watch dramas or edit pictures.</p> </blockquote>
