<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTS. 3 letters but this group made such a huge impact to me. Bangtan seonyeondan, bulletproof boy scouts or beyond the scene, when translated in 
English, also called BTS is a k-pop group who are constantly breaking through records. The group consists of 7 members from different places from South Korea. I think 
it's normal for a fan to truly admire an artist. Well they are called idol for a reason. However, each member's story of how they started and dreamed inspires me. The 
group debuted June 13, 2013 with their album 2 kool 4 skool/Too Cool For School.

<a name="nj">
<img src="nj.png" align="right" title="Kim Namjoon">
<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Kim Namjoon, the leader of the group, is the first member of BTS. He was already recruited year 2010 and he was active before 
as an underground rapper together. He was later joined with 2 more underground rappers which I will talk about later. Namjoon has an IQ of 148 and he taught his self 
English which he can now speak fluently. He wrote and produced a lot of music including his own mixtape. In their latest album, he has a solo song entitled 
"Reflection". The lyrics were so heartbreaking because it shows how insecure he is. For me, he's one of the best leaders I know because of his hard works especially 
during their world tours when they are being interviewed and Namjoon have to translate the questions being asked to the other members.  
</blockquote>


<a name="sj">
<img src="sj.png" align="left" title="Kim Seokjin">
<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Kim Seokjin, the oldest, is the vocalist and the visual of the group. He graduated from Konkuk University as film arts major 
despite having busy schedule. He was known for always telling the other members and the fans as well that he is handsome. However, despite being confident of his looks,
 he still suffers from low self-esteem. He was offered to be in another group but he rejected it because he thought it was a scam. 
</blockquote>

<a name="my">
<img src="my.png" align="right" title="Min Yoongi">
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Next is Min Yoongi, one of the underground rapper I was talking about earlier. He suffered intense depression, social phobia 
and alleged suicidal thoughts. His family did not support him with his decision to join BTS. Even though his family was not supportive of his decision, he pushed 
through with it and left home. He learned writing songs in middle school and started writing daily after that. 
He had some basic Midi gear that was essential in music-making before entering the company. They were things that he had bought as a lyricist after saving up enough money by 
walking around for two hours every day and skipping dinner every day.
He produced and composed a lot of bts' music.

<a name="jh">
<img src="jh.png" align="left" title="Jung Hoseok">
<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Another member is Jung Hoseok, aka our sunshine. He usually lead the dance choreography and motivates other members when 
learning a new dance. Just like Yoongi, his dad was against his dream and because of that, he felt that he was a disappointment. He suffered from panic attacks and 
anxiety issues. He was so down and did not know if he would ever make it. However, despite feeling that, he never fails to radiate happiness to others. 
</blockquote>

<a name="jm">
<img src="jm.png" align="right" title="Park Jimin">
<br>
<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Next is Park Jimin the lead dancer. He graduated from Busan high school of Arts and his teacher suggested that he try 
auditioning to an entertainment company. He suffered from low self confidence due to his weight. His parents are always worried about him and are always asking if he 
is eating properly. He tried losing weight and was successful in doing so. However, Jimin is much more than his abs or muscles, he also has a  nice voice and 
personality. </blockquote>


<a name="kth">
<img src="kth.png" align="left" title="Kim Taehyung">
<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Second to the last is Kim Taehyung aka V. He was just a small kid from a farm . When he was moving to Seoul, he's grandmother 
bought him an expensive jacket because she was scared that boys from Seoul will make fun of him. During one of their tour, he shared that his grandma died just recently. 
She died before he can even dedicate their win to her. In addition, when his friends did not accept Jimin, he got upset and bought Jimin a 1100 dollar sweater. 
</blockquote>

<a name="jk">
<img src="jk.png" align="right" title="Jeon Jeongguk">
<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Lastly, the youngest, Jeon Jungkook. He debuted with the group at the age of 15.  He was offered by eight different 
entertainment agencies but when he saw Namjoon's performance, he said he had found what he was looking for. In addition, during one of their interviews he admitted
 that he only cry when he sees the other members cry. He said he can take the pain as long as the other members aren't hurt. He even dedicated a song to them in their 
latest album and it is entitled "Begin". </blockquote>


<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Recently, they received an award from Billboard Music Award (BBMA) making them the first K-pop group to be invited, nominated 
and most especially, to win an award in BBMA. Last year, they also won the "Daesang" or Artist of the year in Seoul Music Award which led BTS and the fans to cry 
because of joy. They started from giving posters to invite people to attend their concert to having a sold out world tour concert. They truly deserved to win those 
awards. Despite of having recognition from all over the world, they remain humble and respectful especially to those artists that are here first in the music industry.
We, the fans (aka ARMYs), are very proud of them for achieving this much. </blockquote>

<blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

BTS got my attention because of their extraordinary dance moves, music and of course, their looks. Honestly, I was really hooked first because of their dance moves and then I appreciated their good looks after that. Their songs are really good. They don't give too much focus on songs about breakup or anything related to that but on issues like women empowerment (21st Century Girls), Politics (Change), Mental health (The Last) and so much more. As I was watching their videos on their variety show (almost on a daily basis), I learned that they're not just some Korean group who are just well-known because of their looks but also because of their talents and most especially, their personality. How they act in front of their managers, camera and other staffs is the same when they are already alone. They usually do Vlive in which they video chat with the fans and they talk about how did their day went and such. And during this video chat they typically do it inside their rooms so it means they are away from their managers and cameras. I admire them so much because of their passion for music and their dreams. Despite of receiving negative feedbacks from people they thought would support them, feeling bad about their selves, and experiencing tragic situations, they still chased their dreams. I don't regret meeting these boys because they are truly an inspiration. I, myself, experienced what they went through. I thought people who are dear to me would cheer for me and support me but I was wrong. It was the other way around. Just like Yoongi, I also had suicidal thoughts. However, upon hearing the story of Yoongi, it seriously inspired me to keep going. Each members have a heart warming and heart breaking stories to tell and each have lessons to be learned. Their stories and songs helped me to realize several things in life. They helped me stand up again and go on with my life and keep on chasing my dreams. They motivated me to dream more and believe that I will achieve it. I will never get tired of supporting them because they inspire so many people. </blockquote>
