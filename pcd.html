<h3 align="center"> BTS Concert Experience: <em>A trip to memory lane </em></h3>

<hr><br>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;A day/night full of extreme joy, adrenaline rush and friendship. A night that I will never forget. 

<strong>The Wings Tour in Manila.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="calibri"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most influential kpop group performed in Manila last May 06 and May 07. It's every fangirl's dream to attend to the concert of her favorite group. Luckily, I was able to witness the legendary concert of BTS. 
But before the fun, we had to experience suffering aka ticket selling. There are 2 ways that you can acquire a ticket, online and buying it in actual 
ticket selling stores. I decided to buy it online but it was still stressful. I had to wake up really early because I want to get a good seat and fortunately, I did! 
I was anxious of going alone so I looked for concert buddies on twitter and I found not one but six of them! </p> </blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast forward to the concert day. I woke up really early because my concert buddies and I want to spend time together before the 
concert proper and also to collect freebies. I arrived in Mall Of Asia around 10:00 am and looked for Myles and Nica. We roamed around MOA to collect goodies and went
 to the standees. It was about 12:00 when we went to take a picture with the standees and we haven't taken our lunch yet plus it was really hot. Nonetheless, it was 
worth it because we might not have the chance to take a photo with the real members but we got to take a photo with the life sized standees of them!!! After that, we 
ate lunch. We were all excited but of course food is important especially if we're going to watch a 3-hour concert. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management said that they will let people in at around 4:30 PM and we finished eating around 3PM so we decided to line up. I thought my suffering has ended but 
no, there's a part two (haha). We waited for hours just to get inside the venue. It was really really really tiring. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hours of waiting, we finally went inside!!! They were playing music videos and fans (aka ARMYs) were reciting the fanchant 
loudly while waving their army bombs (lightstick). My concert buddies were not seated next to me but it's fine with me since I made a new friend again aka my seatmate 
(hahahaha).  At exactly 6 PM, the concert started off with BTS' song "Not Today". We were all singing and dancing along with them.  <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few songs, they started the
introductions and they spoke in Filipino! Since I attended Day 2, we already know that they will speak in Tagalog but I was still freaking out because they were 
too cute nvfdjvd!!! Here's a video of them speaking in Tagalog [note: it's a really really shaky fancam]: </p>

<br><br><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the members even wrote "Mahal Kita" in a bond paper. They performed 20+ songs with an amazing choreography! 
My favorite performace was Cypher pt.4! It's a diss song for ANTIs telling them to love theirselves instead of hating on BTS and their fans. This song was performed by the rap line!

<br><br><p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were singing the song that they made for ARMYs, I knew that the concert was 
coming to an end. I was just standing there, looking at the whole arena, looking at BTS and thinking "So this is what it feels like to be in this family". I don't even
know why I was so emotional that time but I was just really thankful that I was given a chance to witness them perform live. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the concert was extremely worth it!!! All the fan projects were successfully executed and most importantly, the concert ended without anyone getting hurt. <p>
